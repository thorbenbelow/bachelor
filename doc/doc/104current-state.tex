\chapter{\textbf{Current state of parallelism in JavaScript}}\label{state}
ECMAScript itself has no notion of Threads. It only has the concept of Realms and execution contexts.
Instead the Engines and envrionments that JavaScript is executed in provide methods to create new execution contexts (Threads) and interact with them.

In the Browser these are different kind of Workers.
Currently there are Web, Shared and Service workers.
The Web Worker is akin to a "normal" Thread. It lives only as long as its parent Context and can only communicate with it and contexts that are related to the parent context.

The Shared Worker allows communication with multiple "Parent" contexts. It lives as long as atleast one parent context is still alive.

The Service Worker can persist even after the parent context is already closed. It can communicate with all other contexts that have the same origin.

nodejs and deno provide Worker Threads. Theses behave similar to threads known in other programming languages.
